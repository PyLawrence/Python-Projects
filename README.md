# The basics of Python
## This repo includes a couple small projects with some other even smaller applications that go through the basics

### Projects:
- Phonebook
- FileChecker
- WebPageCreator

#### PhoneBook
This project acts as a contact management system. The user is able to add a contact with the major contact details, including name, phone number, and email.
This info is stored in a database and is neatly displayed to the user.

#### FileChecker
This project will give the user the ability to transfer all files of a selected file type from one directory to another.
This process can bet setup to happen automatically or done manually using the provided GUI.

#### WebPageCreator
This project gives the user the ability to generate and modify webpages quickly. When a new file is created, default metadata is loaded on to a file.
The GUI only exposes the ability to modify the title of the page, and the body, so there's no clutter on the user end.
